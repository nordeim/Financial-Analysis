### **Part 1: The System Architecture - A Visual Blueprint**

Before we lay the bricks, let's look at the architectural diagram of the system we are building. This visualizes the modular, fail-safe workflow we designed.

### **Part 2: The Deployment - Step-by-Step Setup Guide**

Follow these instructions precisely to set up your environment. This is a one-time setup.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.8 or newer installed.
*   A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
*   An API key from a Large Language Model provider. We will use OpenAI for this example. You can get one from the OpenAI platform.

---

**Step 1: Create Your Project Folder**

First, create a dedicated folder for your project. Let's call it `FinAnalystAI`. Inside this folder, create the file structure as shown below. You will populate these files with the code from Part 3.

```
FinAnalystAI/
├── main.py
├── config.py
├── data_retriever.py
├── market_data.py
├── ratio_calculator.py
├── report_generator.py
└── requirements.txt
```

**Step 2: Secure Your API Key**

Your AI's "brain" (the LLM) requires an API key. **Never hardcode this key directly in your scripts.** We will use an environment variable for security.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in your `FinAnalystAI` directory.
2.  Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `sk-your-secret-key` with your actual OpenAI API key:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-secret-key"
    ```
3.  **Crucially**, if you are using a version control system like Git, add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from ever being committed.

**Step 3: Set Up the Python Virtual Environment**

This isolates your project's dependencies, preventing conflicts.

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate into your `FinAnalystAI` folder.
2.  Create the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate it:
    *   **On Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   **On macOS/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(venv)`, indicating the environment is active.

**Step 4: Install All Required Libraries**

With your virtual environment active, run this single command to install all the powerful Python libraries we need to execute our mission:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(You will create the `requirements.txt` file in the next section).*

You have now successfully set up the entire operating environment. The stage is set for the code.

### **Part 3: The Code - Building the Machine**

Here is the complete, modular code for each file. Copy and paste the content into the corresponding files you created in your `FinAnalystAI` directory.

#### **`requirements.txt`**
This file lists all project dependencies.

```txt
requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml
pandas
pdfplumber
yfinance
openai
python-dotenv
```

#### **`config.py`**
This module securely loads configuration and API keys.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Securely fetch the API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Set a user-agent to identify our bot to servers
# This is a polite and professional practice.
HEADERS = {
    'User-Agent': 'FinAnalystAI/1.0 (YourName/YourContact; Autonomous Financial Analysis Bot)'
}

# Check if the API key is available
if not OPENAI_API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("OpenAI API key not found. Please set it in the .env file.")

```

#### **`data_retriever.py`**
This is the heart of our data gathering operation. It's robust and follows our API-first, scrape-second strategy.

```python
import requests
import re
import pandas as pd
import pdfplumber
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#### **`market_data.py`**
Simple and effective, this module gets real-time market data.

```python

#### **`report_generator.py`**
The AI Analyst. This module interfaces with the LLM to generate the final human-readable report.

```python

    print("\n" + "="*50)
    print(f"SUCCESS: Financial analysis complete.")
    print(f"Report saved to: {report_filename}")
    print("="*50)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Part 4: The Execution - Your Automated Analyst at Work**

With everything set up and the code in place, you are now ready to run your AI analyst.

**Step 1: Open Your Terminal**
Make sure you are in the `FinAnalystAI` directory and your virtual environment `(venv)` is active.

**Step 2: Run the Command**
Execute the script by providing a ticker symbol. Let's try Apple Inc. (`AAPL`):

```bash
python main.py --ticker AAPL
```

You can try others as well:
*   For Microsoft: `python main.py --ticker MSFT`
*   For NVIDIA: `python main.py --ticker NVDA`
*   For Google: `python main.py --ticker GOOGL`

**Step 3: Watch the Magic Happen**
Your terminal will show the progress as the system works:
1.  It will map the ticker to a CIK.
2.  It will fetch data from the SEC.
3.  It will parse the HTML filing.
4.  It will fetch real-time market data from Yahoo Finance.
5.  It will calculate the financial ratios.
6.  It will send the compiled data to the LLM for analysis.
7.  Finally, it will announce that the report is saved.

**Step 4: Review Your Report**
A new file, such as `AAPL_financial_report.md`, will appear in your folder. Open this Markdown file. You will see a professionally formatted report with an executive summary, detailed analysis, and a clean data table—all generated in seconds, without any human intervention.

### **Conclusion & Your Path Forward**

Congratulations. You have not just been given code; you have been given a system. A powerful, autonomous engine that operationalizes our advanced strategic plan. This tool elevates you from a passive observer of data to an active commander of automated analysis.

**Your creative journey does not end here. Consider these future enhancements:**
*   **Historical Analysis:** Modify the `DataRetriever` to pull the last 3-5 years of 10-K reports to enable trend analysis.
*   **Industry Benchmarking:** Add functionality to run the analysis for multiple tickers in the same industry and have the AI compare them.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Use a library like `Streamlit` or `Gradio` to build a simple web UI on top of this backend.
*   **Scheduled Reports:** Use a cron job (on Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to run this script automatically every quarter for your favorite stocks and email you the reports.

## Executive Summary: The Dawn of the AI Analyst

In an era where data is the new oil, the ability to rapidly and accurately analyze financial information is the engine of modern investment. For decades, this power was siloed within large financial institutions, accessible only through armies of analysts and expensive terminals. **FinAnalystAI** challenges this paradigm.

This project is not merely a script; it is a blueprint for an **autonomous financial analysis engine**. It is a system designed to be built *by* a generative AI (like Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini) and then, in turn, *leverage* a generative AI to perform its analysis. It autonomously navigates the web, extracts critical financial data directly from company filings, performs quantitative calculations, and generates sophisticated, human-readable investment reports—all without human intervention.

We are democratizing institutional-grade analysis, making it accessible, repeatable, and scalable for individual investors, students, and FinTech developers.

### The Problem: The Analyst's Dilemma

Any seasoned investor or developer who has attempted to automate financial analysis has faced the same daunting challenges:

1.  **The Data Maze:** Financial data is scattered across the web in a chaotic mix of formats. SEC filings can be in HTML, XBRL, or PDF. Investor relations sites have inconsistent layouts. A simple web scraper is brittle and will break the moment a website's CSS changes.
2.  **The Extraction Hurdle:** Finding the data is only half the battle. Extracting it is even harder. How do you programmatically distinguish "Total Revenue" from "Net Revenue"? How do you parse a number written as `(1,234,567)` in a PDF table and know it's a negative value?
3.  **The Analysis Gap:** Raw numbers are meaningless without context. Calculating ratios like P/E or Debt-to-Equity is the first step, but interpreting them—understanding what they signify about a company's health and valuation—is the true art. This interpretive step has historically been a purely human domain.

### The Solution: A New Paradigm

FinAnalystAI overcomes these challenges by implementing a sophisticated, multi-layered strategy. It is built on a foundation of professional software engineering principles and cutting-edge AI integration. It is robust where others are brittle, intelligent where others are naive, and analytical where others are merely descriptive. This README will guide you through the philosophy, architecture, and implementation of this groundbreaking system.

## The Guiding Philosophy: Building an Unbreakable System

The resilience and autonomy of FinAnalystAI are not accidental. They are the result of three core design principles that were meticulously planned before a single line of code was conceived.

### 1. Modularity: A Symphony of Specialists

A monolithic script attempting to do everything is a single point of failure. Our system is architected as a collection of specialized Python modules, each with a single, clear responsibility.

*   `data_retriever.py`: The **Data Detective**, responsible for hunting down and extracting financial numbers.
*   `market_data.py`: The **Market Ticker**, connecting to real-time stock price information.
*   `ratio_calculator.py`: The **Quant**, a pure-math engine for calculating key metrics.
*   `report_generator.py`: The **AI Analyst**, which interfaces with a large language model to write the narrative report.
*   `main.py`: The **Orchestrator**, conducting the entire workflow from start to finish.

This modularity makes the system transparent, debuggable, and infinitely extensible. Upgrading the PDF parsing logic, for example, only requires modifying one module without affecting the others.

### 2. API-First, Scrape-Second: The Path of Least Resistance

Web scraping is a last resort, not a first choice. It is inherently fragile. Our system embodies this professional-grade principle by prioritizing structured, reliable data sources.

*   **Attempt 1 (The API):** The system first targets the **SEC EDGAR API**. This is the gold standard for US-listed companies, providing machine-readable access to official filings. This path is fast, reliable, and accurate.
*   **Attempt 2 (The Fallback):** Only if the API fails or is not applicable (e.g., for some international companies) does the system pivot to its intelligent scraping module. This isn't a blind scraper; it uses targeted search to find "Investor Relations" pages and looks for specific keywords and document types, mimicking the logic of a human researcher.

This hybrid approach maximizes the probability of successfully acquiring data autonomously.

### 3. Fail-Safe Operation: Intelligence in the Face of Chaos

The internet is an unpredictable environment. Servers go down, websites change, and data formats are inconsistent. FinAnalystAI is built for this reality.

Every external interaction—every network request, file download, and data parsing attempt—is wrapped in robust `try...except` blocks. Failure is not a crash-worthy event; it is an expected scenario. The system logs the error, assesses the situation, and attempts to continue with the data it has. For instance, if it fails to extract financial statement data but succeeds in getting market data, it will still proceed to generate a report based on market valuation metrics alone, noting the data gap. This anti-fragile design is the key to true, unsupervised automation.

## System Architecture: A Deep Dive into the Machine

Understanding the flow of data through the system is critical to appreciating its design.

### Module-by-Module Breakdown

*   **`main.py` (The Orchestrator):** This is the conductor. It parses the user's command-line input (the ticker symbol) and calls each module in the correct sequence. It handles the top-level control flow, ensuring that the output of one module becomes the input for the next.

*   **`config.py` (The Vault):** Security and configuration are paramount. This module uses `python-dotenv` to load sensitive information like your OpenAI API key from a `.env` file, keeping it out of the main codebase. It also defines a global `User-Agent` header, a crucial best practice for identifying our bot politely to web servers.

*   **`data_retriever.py` (The Data Detective):** This is the most complex and critical module.
    1.  It first maps the stock ticker to its SEC CIK number.
    2.  It uses this CIK to query the SEC EDGAR API for the latest 10-K (annual report) filing.
    3.  If successful, it gets a direct link to the filing, typically in HTML format.
    4.  The `extract_data_from_html` method then uses a powerful combination of `pandas` and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the document. It doesn't just grab tables blindly; it intelligently searches for specific financial keywords (`'total revenue'`, `'net income'`, etc.) to find the exact data points required.
    5.  It includes a sophisticated `_parse_financial_value` helper function to clean the data, converting strings like `"$ (1,234)"` into the number `-1234`.

*   **`market_data.py` (The Market Ticker):** Financial reports only tell part of the story. This module uses the `yfinance` library to connect to Yahoo Finance's robust API, fetching real-time data that is essential for valuation ratios: current stock price, market capitalization, and shares outstanding.

*   **`ratio_calculator.py` (The Quant):** This is the pure-math engine. It takes the structured data from the retrieval and market modules and performs the crucial ratio calculations (P/E, P/S, Debt-to-Equity, etc.). It operates with "safe division" to prevent zero-division errors, a hallmark of robust code.

*   **`report_generator.py` (The AI Analyst):** This is where the magic happens. After all the data has been gathered and calculated, this module's job is to communicate the findings.
    1.  It bundles all the enriched data into a clean, well-formatted JSON object.
    2.  It embeds this JSON within a carefully engineered "runtime prompt."
    3.  It sends this prompt to a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) via the OpenAI API.
    4.  It receives the AI-generated narrative report and returns it for final output.

## The "Dual-AI" Engine: Our Core Innovation

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence in two distinct and powerful ways, a concept we call the "Dual-AI Engine."

### AI #1: The System Architect (The "Builder")

The entire Python codebase for this project was designed to be generated by a state-of-the-art coding AI (such as Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, or OpenAI's GPT-4 via Copilot). We achieve this by feeding the AI a "System Generation Master Prompt," which acts as a comprehensive architectural blueprint. This prompt doesn't just ask for a "script"; it specifies the modular design, the error handling, the class structures, the methods, and the core logic. It asks the AI to act as a world-class FinTech software architect.

### AI #2: The Financial Analyst (The "Interpreter")

Once the system is built, it contains within it a module (`report_generator.py`) that makes its own calls to an LLM. This is the second AI in our engine. Its job is not to write code, but to *interpret data*. The system feeds it clean, structured financial numbers and ratios, and prompts it to act as a senior financial analyst. This AI writes the final narrative report, turning sterile numbers into actionable insights.

This dual-AI approach represents a new frontier in automation: using AI to build tools that then use AI to perform expert-level tasks.

## The Master Prompts: Blueprints for Intelligence

The quality of an AI's output is dictated by the quality of its prompt. We have engineered two distinct, high-level prompts that power our Dual-AI Engine.

### The System Generation Master Prompt

This is the prompt given to a coding AI to build the entire application. It's a detailed specification that ensures a high-quality, robust, and modular codebase.

> **(An excerpt from the full prompt)**
>
> `You are a world-class AI Software Architect specializing in financial technology (FinTech) and data engineering. Your task is to design and generate a complete, production-ready, and autonomous Python system for financial analysis.`
>
> `**Core Architectural Principles:**`

>    `- Method 1: get_filings_from_sec(ticker): ...`
>    `- Method 2: extract_financial_data(document_url): ...`
>    `- **Intelligent Data Point Extraction:** For each financial statement...extract the following key line items... Use regex to find the line item text...`
>
> `... (continues with detailed specifications for all other modules)`

### The Report Generation Runtime Prompt

This is the prompt that the generated Python script (`report_generator.py`) sends to the OpenAI API during its execution. It is engineered to coax a high-quality, structured analysis from the LLM.

> `You are a Senior Financial Analyst at a top-tier investment firm. Your analysis is data-driven, concise, and professional.`
> `Based *only* on the financial data provided below for [Company Name], write a sharp investment analysis report.`
>
> `**Financial Data Snapshot:**`
> ````json
> {
>   "revenue": "89,498,000,000.00",
>   "net_income": "22,956,000,000.00",
>   "total_assets": "352,583,000,000.00",
>   "current_price": "170.12",
>   "market_cap": "2,650,000,000,000.00",
>   "pe_ratio": "28.97",
>   "ps_ratio": "7.51",

> `3.  **Data & Ratios Summary Table:** Conclude with a clean, easy-to-read Markdown table...`
> `4.  **Important:** Do not invent any data. Base your entire analysis strictly on the numbers provided. Be objective.`

This level of prompt engineering is what elevates the final output from a simple summary to a credible piece of financial analysis.

## Deployment & Usage: Your Step-by-Step Guide

Get your own instance of FinAnalystAI running in under 5 minutes.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   An OpenAI API Key for the report generation module.

### Step 1: Project Setup
Clone this repository or create the folder structure and files as described in the architecture section.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FinAnalystAI.git
cd FinAnalystAI
```

### Step 2: Environment & API Key Configuration
This project uses a `.env` file to handle your API key securely.

1.  **Create the file:**
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
2.  **Add your key:** Open the `.env` file and add the following line, pasting your own secret key from OpenAI.
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-secret-key-goes-here"
    ```
3.  **Set up the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### Step 3: Installation
Install all required libraries with a single command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Execution
Run the analysis from your terminal, providing a ticker symbol with the `--ticker` flag.

```bash
# Analyze Apple Inc.
python main.py --ticker AAPL

# Analyze Microsoft
python main.py --ticker MSFT

# Analyze NVIDIA
python main.py --ticker NVDA
```

The system will print its progress to the console and save the final report as a Markdown file (e.g., `AAPL_financial_report.md`) in the project directory.

## Example Output: The Final Product

Below is a sample of the high-quality report generated for a company like Apple (`AAPL`).

> ```markdown
> # Financial Analysis Report: Apple Inc. (AAPL)
>
> ### **Executive Summary**
>
> Based on the latest financial data, Apple Inc. demonstrates robust profitability and a strong market valuation. The company's significant revenue and net income underscore its dominant market position. The current valuation, reflected in its P/E and P/S ratios, suggests high investor confidence, while its solvency remains manageable.
>
> ### **Analysis of Key Areas**
>
> #### **Valuation**
>
> With a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.97, the market is pricing Apple's stock at nearly 29 times its annual earnings. This is a premium valuation, indicating that investors expect strong future growth. The Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 7.51 further supports this, showing that the company's market capitalization is over seven times its annual revenue, a testament to its powerful brand and high-margin business model.
>
> #### **Solvency**
>
> The Debt-to-Equity ratio stands at 1.46. This indicates that the company uses a significant amount of debt to finance its assets relative to the value of its stockholders' equity. While this level of leverage can amplify returns, it also introduces financial risk that warrants monitoring.
>
> ### **Data & Ratios Summary Table**

>
> ```

## Technical Deep Dive: Under the Hood

### Choice of Libraries

*   **`requests`**: The gold standard for making HTTP requests to fetch data from APIs and websites.
*   **`BeautifulSoup4` & `lxml`**: The premier combination for parsing HTML. `BeautifulSoup` provides a friendly interface, while `lxml` is a lightning-fast parser.
*   **`pandas`**: While known for data analysis, its `read_html` function is exceptionally powerful and robust for extracting tabular data from web pages.
*   **`pdfplumber`**: An excellent choice for PDF processing. It excels at extracting both text and table structures, which is critical for parsing financial reports saved in PDF format.
*   **`yfinance`**: A widely-used and reliable library for fetching extensive market data from Yahoo Finance, saving us the effort of building our own market data scraper.
*   **`openai`**: The official Python client for interacting with the OpenAI API, making the call to our "AI Analyst" clean and simple.
*   **`python-dotenv`**: A security essential for managing environment variables and keeping secrets out of source code.

### Challenges in Data Extraction

The `data_retriever` module is the result of deep consideration of real-world data problems. It uses regular expressions (`re`) and string normalization to intelligently find keywords, accounting for variations like "Total revenues" vs. "Total Revenue." It also contains logic to handle financial numbers represented in parentheses `(1,234)` as negative values, a common accounting notation that trips up naive parsers.

## Future Vision & Project Roadmap

Version 1.0.0 is a powerful proof-of-concept. The future is even more exciting.

*   **[ ] Historical Trend Analysis:** Enhance the `DataRetriever` to fetch the last 3-5 years of 10-K filings to enable multi-period trend analysis in the final report.
*   **[ ] Industry Benchmarking:** Add functionality to run the analysis for multiple tickers in the same industry (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GOOGL`) and instruct the AI Analyst to compare their key metrics.

Automating financial analysis is a complex but achievable goal that sits at the intersection of data engineering, financial acumen, and advanced AI. A simple prompt is insufficient; what is required is a **master blueprint** for an autonomous system, which a coding AI can then be prompted to build.

Here is the deep-thinking strategy, workflow, and the master prompt to guide a coding AI like "Claude Code" in creating this powerful financial analysis tool.

***

### **Part 1: The Guiding Strategy & Core Philosophy**

Before the prompt, we must establish the philosophy that ensures the system is robust, scalable, and reliable. Simply asking an AI to "scrape a website" is brittle and destined to fail. Websites change their layout, data formats vary, and network errors occur.

Our strategy is based on a **Modular, Fail-Safe, API-First Workflow**.

1.  **Modularity:** The system will not be a single, monolithic script. It will be a collection of specialized modules (Python scripts/classes) that handle distinct tasks: discovering data sources, fetching data, parsing documents, calculating ratios, and generating reports. This makes the system easier to build, debug, and upgrade.

2.  **Fail-Safe Operation:** Every step that involves external interaction (network requests, file parsing) must be wrapped in robust error handling. If one step fails, it should not crash the entire system. It should log the error and, if possible, attempt a fallback method.

3.  **API-First, Scrape-Second:** The user's request mentions "websites," which is the most challenging part. A professional-grade system should **prioritize structured data APIs** (like SEC EDGAR, or financial data providers) because they are reliable and consistent. Web scraping should be the **fallback mechanism**, not the primary one. This hybrid approach provides the best chance of success "without human intervention."

4.  **Generative AI for Both Code and Content:** We will use the coding AI in two phases:
    *   **Phase 1 (System Generation):** Use the master prompt below to generate the Python code for the entire data pipeline.
    *   **Phase 2 (Content Generation):** The generated Python system will, as its final step, call an LLM API (like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini) with the structured financial data to write the final human-readable analysis.

### **Part 2: The Automated Workflow (System Architecture)**

This is the step-by-step process the final Python application will follow. The master prompt will instruct the AI to build code for each of these stages.

1.  **Input:** The system takes a company's stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple Inc.) as its primary input.
2.  **Discovery Module:**
    *   **Attempt 1 (API):** Use the ticker to query the SEC EDGAR API to find links to the latest 10-K (annual) and 10-Q (quarterly) filings. This is the most reliable source for US-listed companies.
    *   **Attempt 2 (Web Scraping - Fallback):** If the API fails or for non-US companies, perform a targeted web search (e.g., "Apple Inc. investor relations" or "Siemens AG investor relations").
    *   **Scraping Logic:** The scraper will then visit the likely Investor Relations page and search for hyperlinks containing keywords like "Annual Report," "Quarterly Report," "10-K," "10-Q," "Financials." It will prioritize official filings (PDFs or XBRL/HTML filings).
3.  **Data Extraction Module:**
    *   It must handle multiple formats: HTML, PDF, and ideally XBRL/XML.
    *   For HTML/XBRL, it will parse structured tables.
    *   For PDFs, it will use an advanced parsing library to extract text and tables. This is the most error-prone step. The logic must search for financial statement keywords (e.g., "Consolidated Statements of Operations," "Consolidated Balance Sheets").
    *   **Key Challenge:** The extractor must be intelligent. It will use regular expressions and natural language understanding to find specific line items like "Total Revenue," "Net Income," "Total Assets," "Long-Term Debt," etc., and their corresponding values, accounting for variations in terminology.
4.  **Data Structuring Module:**
    *   The raw extracted data (e.g., `('Total Revenue', '$383,285 million')`) is cleaned and converted into a standardized JSON object.
    *   Example: `{ "period": "FY2023", "revenue": 383285000000, "net_income": 96995000000, ... }`
5.  **External Data Integration Module:**
    *   For market-based ratios, the system *must* fetch the current stock price and total shares outstanding using a reliable financial data library (e.g., `yfinance` in Python). This data is not in the company's report.
6.  **Ratio Calculation Module:**
    *   This pure-math module takes the structured JSON data and market data as input.
    *   It calculates a pre-defined set of key financial ratios and adds them to the JSON object.
7.  **Report Generation Module:**
    *   The system now has a complete, structured JSON object containing both raw data and calculated ratios for the last few periods.
    *   It formats this data into a clear, concise prompt.
    *   It sends this prompt to a powerful LLM API to generate the final narrative report.
8.  **Output:** The system saves a well-formatted Markdown or PDF report.

### **Part 3: The Master Prompt for the Coding AI**

Here is the masterful, detailed prompt. You would copy and paste this entire block into a powerful coding AI like "Claude Code" or an equivalent.

```prompt
**SYSTEM PROMPT START**

You are a world-class AI Software Architect specializing in financial technology (FinTech) and data engineering. Your task is to design and generate a complete, production-ready, and autonomous Python system for financial analysis.

**High-Level Objective:**
Create a Python application that takes a public company's stock ticker as input, automatically gathers its latest financial data, calculates key accounting and market ratios, and generates a comprehensive analysis report useful for investment decisions. The system must be designed for maximum autonomy and robustness, operating without human intervention.

**Core Architectural Principles:**
1.  **Modularity:** Structure the code into logical, separate modules (e.g., `data_retriever.py`, `ratio_calculator.py`, `report_generator.py`).
2.  **API-First, Scrape-Second:** Prioritize official APIs (like SEC EDGAR) for data retrieval. Use web scraping only as an intelligent fallback.
3.  **Robust Error Handling:** Every network request, file operation, and data parsing attempt must be enclosed in `try...except` blocks with detailed logging.
4.  **Standardized Data Structure:** Use a consistent internal data format (like a dictionary or Pydantic model) to pass data between modules.

**Detailed System Specification:**

Generate the complete Python code for the following system. Please include a `requirements.txt` file.

**1. Main Orchestrator (`main.py`)**
   - This script will be the entry point.
   - It will handle command-line arguments (e.g., `python main.py --ticker AAPL`).
   - It will orchestrate the flow by calling the different modules in sequence.
   - It will handle top-level error logging.

**2. Data Retriever Module (`data_retriever.py`)**
   - Create a class `DataRetriever`.
   - **Method 1: `get_filings_from_sec(ticker)`:**
     - Use the `requests` library to query the SEC EDGAR API (`https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{cik_number}.json`). You will need a helper function to map a ticker to a CIK.
     - Parse the JSON response to find the latest 10-K and 10-Q filings. Return direct links to these documents.
   - **Method 2: `find_reports_via_scraping(company_name)`:**
     - This is the fallback. Use a library like `googlesearch-python` to search for "[Company Name] Investor Relations".
     - Use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` to parse the top search result.
     - On the Investor Relations page, intelligently search for hyperlinks containing keywords: "10-K", "10-Q", "Annual Report", "Quarterly Report", "Financial Statements". Prioritize filings with the most recent year. Return the URLs.
   - **Method 3: `extract_financial_data(document_url)`:**
     - This is the core extraction logic. It must detect the file type (HTML or PDF).
     - **For HTML:** Use `BeautifulSoup4` and `pandas.read_html` to parse tables. Search for tables preceded by headers like "Consolidated Statements of Operations", "Consolidated Balance Sheets".
     - **For PDF:** Use the `pdfplumber` library, which is excellent for extracting text and tables from PDFs.
     - **Intelligent Data Point Extraction:** For each financial statement (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), extract the following key line items for the last two fiscal periods available in the report. Use `regex` to find the line item text (e.g., `re.search(r'(?i)total revenue|net sales', text)`) and then extract the corresponding numerical value. Account for negative values in parentheses and units (e.g., "in millions").
     - **Required Data Points:**
       - **Income Statement:** Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Income, Net Income.
       - **Balance Sheet:** Cash and Cash Equivalents, Total Current Assets, Total Assets, Total Current Liabilities, Total Liabilities, Total Stockholders' Equity.
       - **Cash Flow Statement:** Net Cash from Operating Activities, Capital Expenditures, Free Cash Flow (Operating Cash Flow - Capex).
   - **Return Value:** The extractor should return a list of dictionaries, one for each period found, in a standardized format: `{'period': 'Q4 2023', 'revenue': 12345, ...}`.

**3. Market Data Module (`market_data.py`)**
   - Create a function `get_market_data(ticker)`.
   - Use the `yfinance` library to get the current stock price, market capitalization, and total shares outstanding for the given ticker.
   - Return this data in a dictionary.

**4. Ratio Calculator Module (`ratio_calculator.py`)**
   - Create a class `RatioCalculator`.
   - It will take the structured financial data from the retriever and the market data as input.
   - It must calculate the following ratios. Provide the formula in the comments for each calculation.
     - **Profitability Ratios:**
       - Gross Profit Margin
       - Operating Profit Margin
       - Net Profit Margin
     - **Liquidity Ratios:**
       - Current Ratio
     - **Solvency Ratios:**
       - Debt-to-Equity Ratio
     - **Market Valuation Ratios:**
       - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
       - Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio
   - It should append these calculated ratios to the main data dictionary.

**5. Report Generator Module (`report_generator.py`)**
   - Create a class `ReportGenerator`.
   - It will take the final, enriched data dictionary (raw financials + ratios) as input.
   - It will have one method: `generate_text_report(data)`.
   - **This method will make an API call to a generative LLM (e.g., using the `openai` library).**
   - Construct a detailed prompt for the LLM. The prompt should include all the extracted data and ratios, clearly formatted.
   - **The prompt to the LLM should be:**
     ```
     "You are a Senior Financial Analyst. Based on the following financial data for [Company Name] for periods [Period 1] and [Period 2], write a concise investment analysis report.
     
     **Data:**
     [Insert the clean JSON data here]
     
     **Report Structure:**
     1.  **Executive Summary:** A 3-sentence summary of the company's financial health and performance.
     2.  **Profitability Analysis:** Comment on the margins (Gross, Operating, Net) and their trends.
     3.  **Liquidity & Solvency:** Briefly assess the company's short-term health (Current Ratio) and long-term leverage (Debt-to-Equity).
     4.  **Market Valuation:** Interpret the P/E and P/S ratios. Is the stock potentially overvalued or undervalued based on these metrics?
     5.  **Data Summary Table:** Present the key data points and ratios in a clean Markdown table.
     
     Be objective and data-driven in your analysis."
     ```
   - The function will return the LLM's generated text response.

**6. `requirements.txt`**
   - Create this file listing all necessary libraries:
     ```
     requests
     beautifulsoup4
     lxml
     pandas
     pdfplumber
     yfinance
     openai
     # Add googlesearch-python or equivalent if you use one
     ```

Please now generate the complete, multi-file Python application based on this architecture. Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and follows best practices.

**SYSTEM PROMPT END**
