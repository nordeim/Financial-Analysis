## Workflow and Data Pipeline

### 1. Input Specification

The system is designed to operate with a single, simple input: **the stock ticker** (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `TSLA`).

**Advanced Usage**: Optional arguments include output format, depth of analysis, industry benchmarking, peer comparison, time period, and quality thresholds.

### 2. Data Discovery & Acquisition

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **SEC EDGAR (for US companies):** Fetches 10-K (annual) and 10-Q (quarterly) filings, using CIK mapping and XBRL parsing.
- **Investor Relations Webpages:** Web search and scraping for non-US companies or as a fallback.
- **Financial Data APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage):** Provides market data, price history, and fundamentals.

**Key Features:**
- Respects robots.txt and implements rate-limiting.
- Logs every data source with timestamp and retrieval method.
- Fallback logic ensures that if one source fails, others are attempted.

### 3. Data Extraction & Structuring

**Flexible Parsers:**
- **XBRL/XML:** Direct extraction of structured financial data.
- **HTML:** Table detection and extraction using BeautifulSoup and pandas.
- **PDF:** Advanced table/text extraction using pdfplumber and regular expressions.

**Standardization:**
- All data structured into canonical financial statement formats:
  - Income Statement
  - Balance Sheet

**Key Elements:**
- Explicit instructions for modular design: separate files for main orchestrator, data retriever, extractor, validator, ratio calculator, benchmarking, report generator, and utilities.
- API-first, scrape-second data acquisition philosophy.
- Robust validation and auditability requirements.
- Detailed reporting structure, including a narrative generated by LLMs.
- Requirements for output formats, error handling, and extensibility.

**Excerpt from the Master Prompt:**
> "You are a world-class AI Software Architect specializing in financial data engineering and modern UI/reporting. Your task is to design and generate a modular, robust, and production-ready Python application that automates financial analysis of publicly listed companies for investment decision-making.
