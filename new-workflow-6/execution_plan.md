The user wants me to act as CodeNavigator to re-imagine a complete, automated financial analysis system.
This is a large, complex task. I need to break it down into a systematic, detailed execution plan as requested.

**1. Deconstruct the Request:**

*   **Objective:** Build a comprehensive, automated financial analysis system.
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Extract real-time financial data from public sources (websites, SEC filings).
    *   Calculate key financial ratios.
    *   Generate professional, "investment-grade" analysis reports.
*   **Key Constraint:** "Without human intervention." This points towards robust automation and error handling.
*   **Input:** Stock ticker symbol.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Analyze the Provided `sample_workflow_and_readme.md`:** This file contains a monolithic Python script and a detailed specification. I need to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses to inform my re-imagined plan.
        *   **Strengths:** Good starting point, identifies key libraries, defines data structures (`FinancialData`, `FinancialRatios`), outlines classes for different responsibilities (Extractor, Calculator, Analyzer, Reporter), includes ethical considerations (rate limiting, user agent), has a main execution block.
        *   **Weaknesses:** It's a single, monolithic script. This is hard to maintain, test, and extend. The extraction logic is highly simplified and hardcoded (`_get_cik`, `_get_company_ir_urls`), which won't work for a general-purpose tool. The "analysis" is very basic and template-driven. The error handling is present but could be more sophisticated. It mixes concerns (e.g., `FinancialAnalysisEngine` knows about both extraction and calculation). The "investment recommendation" part is tricky and needs careful handling with disclaimers. The spec asks for things the sample doesn't fully deliver (e.g., historical data, industry benchmarking, multi-format parsing).
    *   **Create a Re-imagined Execution Plan:** This is the main deliverable. It needs to be detailed, logical, and phased.
    *   **Define File Hierarchy:** A modular structure is crucial. I'll propose a package structure instead of a single file.
    *   **Define Files, Goals, Interfaces, Checklists:** For each file in my proposed hierarchy, I need to be specific about its purpose.
    *   **Use Web Searches:** The prompt explicitly asks for this to validate assumptions. I need to consider real-world data sources like the SEC EDGAR API and how to reliably get company CIKs and IR URLs. I'll search for "how to get company CIK from ticker", "SEC EDGAR API documentation", "reliable free financial data APIs".
    *   **Format:** Adhere strictly to the requested format: ````ext ... ```` blocks for files, `# File: <path>` comment on the first line.
    *   **Approval Step:** The user wants to review the plan *before* I proceed with the full implementation. My output for this step is the plan itself.

**2. High-Level Strategy for the Re-imagined System:**

*   **Modular Architecture:** I will propose a Python package structure. This promotes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. A monolithic script is not a "well defined and fully tested working system."
*   **Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control:** Instead of `FinancialAnalysisEngine` creating its own `FinancialDataExtractor`, I'll design it to receive dependencies. This makes testing much easier (e.g., I can inject a mock extractor).
*   **Robust Data Sourcing:** The sample code's hardcoded CIKs and URLs are a major flaw. I'll propose a more dynamic approach.
    *   Use a reliable library or API to map tickers to CIKs (e.g., the SEC's own mapping file).
    *   Use a more robust SEC data fetching mechanism, perhaps leveraging a dedicated library like `sec-edgar-api` or `python-edgar` to handle the complexities of filings.
    *   For general company info (name, website), `yfinance` is a good option.
*   **Pluggable Data Sources:** I will design the extraction layer to be extensible. We should have different "Provider" classes (e.g., `SecEdgarProvider`, `YahooFinanceProvider`) that all conform to a common interface. The system can then try them in a prioritized order.
*   **Configuration Driven:** Hardcoded values (like user-agent strings, tickers to test) should be moved to a configuration file (`config.yaml` or `config.py`).
*   **Sophisticated Parsing:** The sample's regex-based number extraction is brittle. I'll propose a more structured approach, acknowledging the difficulty of parsing XBRL/HTML and suggesting a focus on the structured JSON data from the SEC API where possible.
*   **Historical Data:** The spec requires this. The design must accommodate collecting and analyzing data over multiple periods (e.g., a list of `FinancialData` objects, one for each year/quarter).
*   **Clearer Analysis (without giving advice):** The "investment recommendation" is a red flag. I will reframe this as "Synthesis & Key Findings," focusing on summarizing objective data (e.g., "The Debt-to-Equity ratio has increased for 3 consecutive years, indicating rising leverage.") while avoiding prescriptive advice ("You should sell this stock."). Strong disclaimers are paramount.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The plan must include a dedicated `tests/` directory with a structure that mirrors the application code. This is essential for a "fully tested working system."
*   **Project Scaffolding:** I'll include essential project files like `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, and a `main.py` entry point.

**3. Execution Plan Structure:**

I will structure my response as requested: a multi-phase execution plan.

*   **Introduction:** Briefly acknowledge the request, state my understanding of the goal, and praise the detailed specification while explaining why a more modular, robust architecture is necessary to truly fulfill it.
*   **Re-imagined System Architecture & File Hierarchy:** Present a visual tree structure of the proposed project directory. This gives an immediate overview.
*   **Phase 1: Project Foundation & Core Services:**
    *   Setup the project structure.
    *   Define core data models.
    *   Implement configuration management.
    *   Setup logging.
    *   **Files to create:** `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `config/`, `src/financial_analysis/core/`, `main.py`.
*   **Phase 2: Data Sourcing & Extraction Engine:**
    *   Focus on getting the data reliably. This is the most critical and difficult part.
    *   Create an abstract base class for data providers.
    *   Implement concrete providers (SEC EDGAR first, as it's the most reliable source).
    *   Implement a service to manage these providers.
    *   **Files to create:** `src/financial_analysis/data_providers/`, `src/financial_analysis/services/extraction_service.py`.
*   **Phase 3: Analysis & Calculation Framework:**
    *   Implement the ratio calculators.
    *   Design the analysis engine to work with historical data.
    *   **Files to create:** `src/financial_analysis/analysis/`, `src/financial_analysis/services/analysis_service.py`.
*   **Phase 4: Reporting & Output Generation:**
    *   Implement the report generator.
    *   Design it to create multiple formats (Text, Excel, maybe even Markdown/HTML).
    *   **Files to create:** `src/financial_analysis/reporting/`.
*   **Phase 5: Testing & Validation:**
    *   Crucial for robustness.
    *   Define the testing strategy (unit, integration).
    *   Show sample test file structures.
    *   **Files to create:** `tests/`.

For each file, I will provide:
*   **File Path:** e.g., `src/financial_analysis/core/models.py`
*   **Goal and Purpose:** What this file is responsible for.
*   **Interfaces:** Key classes and public methods it will expose.
*   **Checklist:** A list of things to ensure are done correctly for this file.

This approach directly addresses the user's prompt, respects the provided specification while improving upon the sample code, and results in a plan for a professional, maintainable, and robust system. I will be careful to use the requested formatting and persona throughout.

**Web Search Simulation / Knowledge Check:**

*   **Ticker to CIK:** The SEC provides a mapping file at `https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json`. This is the most reliable source. I will incorporate this into my plan. `yfinance` can also provide company info but the SEC source is more direct for CIK.
*   **SEC EDGAR API:** The primary endpoint is `https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/`. There's also the submissions endpoint used in the sample: `https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{cik_number}.json`. The submissions endpoint is great for getting recent filing metadata. The `xbrl` endpoint is for getting the actual standardized financial data. The plan should leverage both.
*   **Parsing XBRL:** This is notoriously complex. Rather than trying to parse the raw XBRL/XML, the plan should prioritize using the JSON data provided by the SEC's API, which is pre-parsed. This dramatically simplifies the extraction process for US-GAAP-compliant companies. The `sec-edgar-api` library can abstract this. I will recommend using it.
*   **Ethical Scraping:** Rate limiting (`10 requests per second` is the SEC guideline), a clear `User-Agent`, and respecting `robots.txt` are key. The sample code includes some of this, but I'll make it more robust and central to the HTTP client service.
*   **Financial Ratios:** The list in the spec is good. I will ensure my plan covers all of them and handles potential `ZeroDivisionError` issues gracefully (e.g., if a denominator is zero).
*   **yfinance library:** This is excellent for getting stock prices (for P/E, P/B ratios), company summary info, and some historical financial data. It can be a valuable secondary/complementary data source to the SEC.

My plan is solid. I will now start writing the response. I will present the execution plan clearly and logically, demonstrating the "deep-thinking" and "systematic" approach required.Of course. As your CodeNavigator, I have meticulously analyzed the project objective, the detailed specifications, and the provided sample implementation. The initial sample provides a solid conceptual foundation, but to build a truly robust, maintainable, and automated system that meets the "investment-grade" aspiration, we must re-imagine the architecture with a more modular and scalable approach.

A monolithic script is difficult to test, extend, and maintain. Therefore, I propose a professional-grade, package-based architecture that separates concerns, enhances testability, and allows for future expansion with new data sources or analysis techniques.

Below is my re-imagined, detailed execution plan. It is structured in logical phases, outlining the file hierarchy and the purpose of each component. I await your approval before proceeding with the implementation.

### Re-imagined System Architecture & File Hierarchy

Instead of a single file, the system will be organized as a proper Python package. This structure promotes modularity and clean separation of concerns.

### **Phase 1: Project Foundation & Core Services**

This phase establishes the project's skeleton, including configuration, logging, and the essential data structures that will be used throughout the application.

**Step 1.1: Create Project Structure and Environment Files**

*   **Files to Create:**
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   `.gitignore`
    *   `README.md` (to be created at the end, but planned for)

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   `requirements.txt`: To define all necessary third-party libraries for easy environment setup (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    *   `.gitignore`: To exclude unnecessary files from version control (e.g., `__pycache__`, virtual environments, log files, generated reports).

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] `requirements.txt` includes `requests`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `yfinance`, `sec-edgar-api`, `pydantic`.
    *   [ ] `.gitignore` is comprehensive and follows Python best practices.

**Step 1.2: Implement Core Data Models**

*   **File to Create:** `src/financial_analysis/core/models.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To define the canonical, strictly-typed data structures for financial statements, ratios, and analysis results. This ensures data consistency across all modules. Using `Pydantic` will provide automatic type validation.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class FinancialStatement(BaseModel)`: Holds data for a single period (e.g., fiscal year 2023). Includes Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow fields.
    *   `class FinancialRatios(BaseModel)`: Holds all calculated ratios for a single period.
    *   `class CompanyAnalysis(BaseModel)`: The final, comprehensive output object, containing company info, multiple periods of `FinancialStatement` and `FinancialRatios` data, and the final qualitative analysis.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] All financial metrics from the specification are included as fields.
    *   [ ] Use `pydantic.BaseModel` for data validation.
    *   [ ] Use `Optional[float]` for fields that may not always be available.
    *   [ ] Include metadata fields like `period`, `fiscal_year`, `source_url`, `retrieval_date`.

**Step 1.3: Setup Configuration and Logging**

*   **Files to Create:**
    *   `src/financial_analysis/core/config.py`
    *   `src/financial_analysis/core/logging_config.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   `config.py`: To centralize all application settings (e.g., SEC User-Agent, request delays, output directories) and prevent hardcoding.
    *   `logging_config.py`: To provide a consistent, application-wide logging configuration that can write to both console and file.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `config.py`: A `Settings` class or object with attributes like `SEC_USER_AGENT`, `REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS`, `REPORTS_DIR`.
    *   `logging_config.py`: A `setup_logging()` function that configures the root logger.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] User-Agent string is descriptive and includes contact info as recommended by the SEC.
    *   [ ] Configuration is easily importable throughout the application.
    *   [ ] Logging is configured to be called once at application startup.

---

### **Phase 2: Intelligent Data Extraction Engine**

This phase focuses on reliably fetching financial data. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for new data sources to be added easily. The SEC EDGAR API will be the primary source due to its authority and structured data format.

**Step 2.1: Define the Data Provider Interface**

*   **File to Create:** `src/financial_analysis/data_providers/base_provider.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To define a common interface (an Abstract Base Class) that all data provider classes must adhere to. This ensures that the `DataService` can use any provider interchangeably.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class BaseDataProvider(ABC)`:
        *   `@abstractmethod def get_company_info(self, ticker: str) -> Dict:`
        *   `@abstractmethod def get_financial_statements(self, ticker: str, num_years: int) -> List[FinancialStatement]:`

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Methods are clearly defined with type hints.
    *   [ ] The class uses `abc.ABC` and `@abstractmethod` to enforce the interface.

**Step 2.2: Implement the SEC EDGAR Data Provider**

*   **File to Create:** `src/financial_analysis/data_providers/sec_edgar_provider.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To implement the logic for fetching and parsing financial data directly from the SEC EDGAR database. This is the most critical data source. It will use the official SEC APIs to get company facts (XBRL data in JSON format).

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class SecEdgarProvider(BaseDataProvider)`: Implements the methods defined in the base class. It will handle ticker-to-CIK conversion, making API requests to SEC endpoints, and parsing the resulting JSON into our `FinancialStatement` models.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Use the SEC's official CIK mapping file for reliable ticker-to-CIK conversion.
    *   [ ] Leverage `https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/` endpoints.
    *   [ ] Implement rate limiting as per SEC guidelines (10 requests/sec).
    *   [ ] Include robust error handling for API errors, missing data, or unknown tickers.
    *   [ ] Map SEC XBRL tags (e.g., `Revenues`, `Assets`) to our internal `FinancialStatement` fields.

**Step 2.3: Implement the Data Orchestration Service**

*   **File to Create:** `src/financial_analysis/services/data_service.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To manage one or more data providers. It will be responsible for fetching data for a given ticker, trying providers in a prioritized order, and consolidating the results.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class DataService`:
        *   `__init__(self, providers: List[BaseDataProvider])`
        *   `fetch_company_financials(self, ticker: str, num_years: int) -> Tuple[Dict, List[FinancialStatement]]`: Fetches company info and statements, orchestrating the configured providers.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] The service accepts a list of providers (Dependency Injection).
    *   [ ] Implements a fallback mechanism (if the primary provider fails, try the secondary).
    *   [ ] Consolidates data from multiple sources if necessary (e.g., company info from one, financials from another).

---

### **Phase 3: Financial Calculation & Analysis Framework**

With reliable data available, this phase focuses on processing it: calculating ratios and generating qualitative insights based on the quantitative data.

**Step 3.1: Implement the Financial Ratio Calculator**

*   **File to Create:** `src/financial_analysis/services/calculation_service.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To perform all financial ratio calculations as defined in the specification. This service will be stateless, taking financial data as input and returning calculated ratios.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class CalculationService`:
        *   `@staticmethod calculate_ratios(statement: FinancialStatement) -> FinancialRatios`: Calculates a full suite of ratios for a single period.
        *   `@staticmethod calculate_historical_trends(ratios_list: List[FinancialRatios]) -> Dict`: Calculates year-over-year growth rates for key ratios.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] All ratios from the specification are implemented.
    *   [ ] Handle potential `ZeroDivisionError` gracefully (e.g., by returning `None` or `0.0` for a ratio if the denominator is zero).
    *   [ ] All calculations are clearly documented with their formulas.

**Step 3.2: Implement the Analysis Engine**

*   **File to Create:** `src/financial_analysis/services/analysis_service.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To translate the raw numbers and ratios into meaningful, human-readable analysis. This is where the system generates insights about liquidity, profitability, etc., based on predefined rules and thresholds.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class AnalysisService`:
        *   `generate_qualitative_analysis(self, historical_ratios: List[FinancialRatios]) -> Dict`: Creates textual analysis for different financial areas (liquidity, leverage, etc.) and an overall assessment.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Analysis functions are modular (e.g., `_analyze_liquidity`, `_analyze_profitability`).
    *   [ ] Analysis considers historical trends (e.g., "ROE has improved for 3 consecutive years").
    *   [ ] **Crucially**, all output is objective and descriptive. Avoids speculative or advisory language like "you should invest." Instead of "Investment Recommendation," the output will be "Key Findings" or "Synthesized Analysis."
    *   [ ] Implements the risk assessment framework from the specification.

---

### **Phase 4: Professional Report Generation**

This phase is responsible for presenting the final analysis in clean, professional formats for the end-user.

**Step 4.1: Implement Report Generators**

*   **Files to Create:**
    *   `src/financial_analysis/reporting/base_reporter.py`
    *   `src/financial_analysis/reporting/text_reporter.py`
    *   `src/financial_analysis/reporting/excel_reporter.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To generate polished reports from the final `CompanyAnalysis` object. The base class ensures a consistent interface, while concrete classes handle specific file formats.

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   `class BaseReporter(ABC)`:
        *   `@abstractmethod generate_report(self, analysis: CompanyAnalysis, output_path: str) -> None:`
    *   `class TextReporter(BaseReporter)`: Generates a formatted `.txt` file.
    *   `class ExcelReporter(BaseReporter)`: Generates a multi-sheet `.xlsx` file using `pandas`, with separate sheets for raw data, ratios, and analysis summary.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Reports include all sections from the specification: Executive Summary, Financial Performance, Risk Assessment, etc.
    *   [ ] All reports must include prominent disclaimers about the educational nature of the tool.
    *   [ ] Data sources and retrieval times are clearly cited in the report.
    *   [ ] The Excel report is well-formatted for readability.

---

### **Phase 5: Orchestration and Testing**

This final phase brings everything together in a main entry point and ensures the system's reliability through comprehensive testing.

**Step 5.1: Create the Main Application Entry Point**

*   **File to Create:** `main.py`

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To be the main executable script that orchestrates the entire pipeline:
        1.  Takes a ticker symbol as input (e.g., from the command line).
        2.  Initializes all the services (Data, Calculation, Analysis).
        3.  Calls the services in sequence to perform the analysis.
        4.  Uses the reporter classes to generate the final output files.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Use `argparse` to handle command-line arguments (e.g., `--ticker AAPL`, `--years 5`).
    *   [ ] Instantiate services and inject dependencies correctly.
    *   [ ] Include top-level error handling for the entire process.
    *   [ ] Print progress messages to the console.

**Step 5.2: Implement a Robust Testing Suite**

*   **Files to Create:** All files within the `tests/` directory.

*   **Goals and Purposes:**
    *   To ensure the correctness and reliability of each component in isolation (unit tests) and their interaction (integration tests).

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   Use the `unittest` or `pytest` framework.
    *   `tests/core/test_models.py`: Test data model validation.
    *   `tests/services/test_calculation_service.py`: Test ratio calculations with known inputs and expected outputs, including edge cases like division by zero.
    *   `tests/data_providers/`: Use mock API responses (saved as JSON files) to test the provider parsing logic without making live network calls.

*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical logic in the calculation and data parsing services.
    *   [ ] Tests are independent and do not rely on external services (networking is mocked).
    *   [ ] A clear strategy is in place for both unit and integration tests.

This execution plan provides a systematic and professional path forward to build the requested system. It improves upon the original concept by introducing a robust, maintainable, and testable architecture. I am ready to proceed with the implementation upon your approval.
