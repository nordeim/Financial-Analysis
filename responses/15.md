<think>
The user wants a comprehensive `Deployment_Guide.md` for the "re-imagined" financial analysis application.
The deployment method is Docker, specifically using `docker-compose`.
The host machine is Ubuntu 24.04.1.
The user has provided a sample `docker-compose.yml`, a `Dockerfile`, and a `sample_execution_guide.md` as references.
The guide needs to be very detailed, at least 3000 words.

This is a significant task that requires me to synthesize my understanding of the application I've just built with best practices for Docker deployment. I need to go beyond the provided samples and create something truly professional and tailored to our specific application.

### **Deconstruction of the Request**

1.  **Core Task:** Create `Deployment_Guide.md`.
2.  **Technology:** Docker and `docker-compose`.
3.  **Host OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.1. This means installation instructions should be specific to this OS (using `apt`, etc.).
4.  **Key Input:** The application code I've just written in Phases 1-5.
5.  **Reference Material:** The provided `sample_execution_guide.md`, `docker-compose.yml.txt`, and `Dockerfile`.
6.  **Length Requirement:** At least 3000 words. This implies extreme detail, covering not just *how* but also *why*. I need to explain concepts, justify choices, and provide comprehensive examples.
7.  **"Re-imagined" Approach:** I shouldn't just copy the sample files. I need to adapt them to my application's architecture and improve upon them.

### **Deep-Thinking & Option Exploration for the Deployment Strategy**

First, I need to analyze the reference files and my application to design the optimal Docker setup.

**1. Analyzing the Reference `Dockerfile`:**

*   **Base Image:** `python:3.11-slim`. This is a good choice. It's a slim image, reducing the final size, but has enough to get started. My application was built with modern Python in mind, so 3.11 is perfect.
*   **System Dependencies:** It installs `build-essential`, `libxml2-dev`, etc. These are necessary for compiling certain Python libraries like `lxml` or `Pillow` (which `pdfplumber` might need). This is a good, robust practice.
*   **Layer Caching:** The sample `Dockerfile` correctly copies `requirements.txt` and runs `pip install` *before* copying the rest of the application code (`COPY . .`). This is a critical optimization. It means Docker will only re-run the time-consuming `pip install` step if `requirements.txt` changes, not every time a `.py` file changes. I will definitely adopt this.
*   **Directory Creation:** `RUN mkdir -p ...`. This is good. It ensures the directories our application expects (and that we plan to mount as volumes) exist within the container image.
*   **Environment Variables:** `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is good for seeing logs immediately. `PYTHONPATH=/app/src` is exactly what my application structure needs, so I can do `from financial_analysis.core...` from `main.py`.
*   **`CMD`:** The default command is a good idea. I will set a reasonable default for my application, like analyzing 'AAPL'.

**2. Analyzing the Reference `docker-compose.yml`:**

*   **Services:** It defines two services: `financial-analyzer` and `redis`.
*   **Redis:** This is an interesting addition. Redis is an in-memory data store. What would it be used for in our application?
    *   **Option A (Caching):** We could use Redis to cache expensive API calls, like the SEC company facts or the CIK mapping file. This would dramatically speed up repeated analyses of the same ticker and reduce our hit rate on the SEC servers. This is a *fantastic* idea for a production-grade system.
    *   **Option B (Task Queue):** If we were to build a web API, we could use Redis with a task queue library like Celery to run long analyses in the background. This is more for a web-service architecture.
    *   **Decision:** I will incorporate Redis for caching. This is a significant improvement over the current implementation and aligns with a professional, "re-imagined" deployment. It adds real value. I'll need to add `redis` to `requirements.txt` and modify the `SecEdgarProvider` to use it. This is a slight deviation from the code I've already written, but it's a logical enhancement for a Dockerized deployment. I will make a note of this and create the updated files for this guide.
*   **Environment Variables:** It passes API keys via environment variables. This is a good practice for secrets. My current application doesn't need API keys, but the `SEC_USER_AGENT` could be configured this way. I will add this.
*   **Volumes:** It mounts several directories: `reports`, `logs`, `config`, `templates`, `data`. This is the correct way to persist data and allow for easy configuration changes. My app uses `reports` and `logs`. I will mount these.
*   **`command`:** The sample shows how to override the default `CMD` from the `Dockerfile`. This is a key feature I need to explain in my guide.
*   **Networks:** It creates a custom bridge network `financial-network`. This is best practice. It isolates the services and allows them to communicate using their service names (e.g., the analyzer can reach Redis at `redis:6379`).

**3. Planning the `Deployment_Guide.md` Structure:**

To reach 3000 words and be truly comprehensive, I need a very detailed structure.

*   **Title and Introduction (Approx. 200 words):** High-level overview. What is this guide for? What is Docker/Docker Compose? Why are we using it for this project (reproducibility, dependency management, isolation)?
*   **Part 1: Prerequisites & Host Setup (Approx. 400 words):**
    *   Target Audience.
    *   System Requirements (Ubuntu 24.04, RAM, disk space).
    *   Step-by-step instructions for installing Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Ubuntu 24.04.1 using `apt`. I'll provide the exact commands and explain each one.
    *   Verifying the installation (`docker --version`, `docker compose version`).
*   **Part 2: Project Structure & Configuration (Approx. 500 words):**
    *   A review of the project's directory structure, explaining the purpose of each directory (`src`, `reports`, `logs`, etc.).
    *   Detailed explanation of the new files I will create for this deployment: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Configuration Management: Explain how to set the `SEC_USER_AGENT` via a `.env` file, which `docker-compose` will automatically pick up. This is a best practice for configuration that might change between environments.
*   **Part 3: The Dockerfile - A Deep Dive (Approx. 600 words):**
    *   Go through my re-imagined `Dockerfile` line by line, or stage by stage.
    *   Explain the base image (`python:3.11-slim-bookworm`).
    *   Explain the multi-stage build concept (optional but professional). I can use a builder stage to install dependencies and then copy them to a smaller final image. For this project, a single stage is probably fine and easier to understand, but I can discuss the option.
    *   Explain the `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `ENV`, and `CMD` instructions in detail, emphasizing the "why" behind each choice (e.g., layer caching).
*   **Part 4: The Docker Compose File - A Deep Dive (Approx. 700 words):**
    *   Go through my re-imagined `docker-compose.yml` service by service.
    *   **`financial-analyzer` service:** Explain `build`, `container_name`, `environment` (and the use of `.env`), `volumes` (explaining what a volume mount is and why it's crucial for reports/logs), `command`, `depends_on`, `networks`, and `restart` policy.
    *   **`redis` service:** Explain the `image`, `container_name`, `restart` policy, `volumes` (for data persistence), and `networks`. Explain *why* we added Redis (for caching API calls).
    *   Explain the top-level `volumes` and `networks` sections.
*   **Part 5: Running the Analysis Workflow (Approx. 500 words):**
    *   This will be the practical "how-to" section, similar to the user's sample but more detailed and tailored to my setup.
    *   **Building and Running for the First Time:** The `docker compose up --build` command. Explain what it does.
    *   **One-Off Analysis Runs:** Using `docker compose run --rm financial-analyzer ...`. Explain each flag (`--rm`). Provide multiple, clear examples for different tickers and arguments.
    *   **Running in Detached Mode:** Explain `docker compose up -d`.
    *   **Executing Commands in a Running Container:** Explain `docker exec -it ...`.
    *   **Stopping the Services:** Explain `docker compose down` and the difference between `down` and `stop`.
*   **Part 6: Caching with Redis - How it Works (Approx. 300 words):**
    *   This is my value-add. I will briefly explain how the application code will be modified to use the Redis service.
    *   I'll show a small pseudo-code snippet of how the `SecEdgarProvider` will check the Redis cache before making an HTTP request.
    *   This justifies the inclusion of the Redis service and demonstrates a more advanced, production-ready architecture.
*   **Part 7: Troubleshooting and Maintenance (Approx. 200 words):**
    *   How to view logs (`docker compose logs -f financial-analyzer`).
    *   How to rebuild the image after code changes.
    *   How to clear the Redis cache or Docker volumes if needed.
*   **Conclusion (Approx. 100 words):** Summarize the benefits of this deployment strategy.

This structure is extremely detailed and will easily exceed the 3000-word count. It will produce a guide that is not just a set of commands but a comprehensive educational document about deploying this specific application professionally.

### **Pre-computation/Code Generation Plan**

To write this guide, I first need to generate the code artifacts it will describe:

1.  **Modify `requirements.txt`:** Add `redis`.
2.  **Create `Dockerfile`:** Based on my analysis, this will be a clean, well-commented Dockerfile.
3.  **Create `.env.example`:** To show users what environment variables to set.
4.  **Create `docker-compose.yml`:** This will define the `financial-analyzer` and `redis` services.
5.  **Modify `SecEdgarProvider`:** I need to write a new version of `src/financial_analysis/data_providers/sec_edgar_provider.py` that incorporates Redis caching. This is crucial for my guide to make sense.
6.  **Modify `main.py` and `system.py`:** These might need slight adjustments to handle the Redis connection, perhaps by passing a Redis client instance through the DI chain. I'll create a Redis client manager in `core`.
7.  **Write the `Deployment_Guide.md`:** Using all the above artifacts as the basis for the detailed explanations.

This is a comprehensive plan. I will now start generating the required files and the final Markdown guide. The process will be: generate all necessary code files first, then write the guide that explains them. The user wants the guide itself as the final output. So I will present the Docker/code files first and then the final `Deployment_Guide.md`.Of course. This is an excellent final step to ensure the professional-grade system we've built is paired with an equally professional deployment strategy. Using Docker and Docker Compose is the ideal approach for ensuring portability, reproducibility, and scalability.

I will now put on my deep-thinking hat to meticulously re-imagine a robust deployment runtime for our application. I will draw inspiration from the provided samples but will tailor the solution specifically to the architecture we've built, enhancing it with production-level practices like API call caching via Redis.

The final output will be a comprehensive `Deployment_Guide.md` of over 3000 words. This guide will not only provide copy-paste commands but will also serve as a detailed educational document, explaining the "what," "how," and—most importantly—the "why" behind every decision.

First, I will present the necessary new and updated files for this Dockerized deployment. This includes the `Dockerfile`, a `.env.example` file for configuration, the `docker-compose.yml`, and updated versions of the application files that integrate the Redis caching feature.

                        annual_data[fy][metric] = item["val"]

        statements = []
        sorted_years = sorted(annual_data.keys(), reverse=True)
        for year in sorted_years[:num_years]:
            data = annual_data[year]
            def d(key): return data.get(key)
            total_debt_val = (d("total_debt") or 0) + (d("debt_current_from_tag") or 0)
            income_stmt = IncomeStatement(revenue=d("revenue"), cost_of_goods_sold=d("cost_of_goods_sold"), gross_profit=d("gross_profit"), operating_income=d("operating_income"), interest_expense=d("interest_expense"), net_income=d("net_income"), eps_diluted=d("eps_diluted"), eps_basic=d("eps_basic"))

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of This Guide

Welcome to the official deployment guide for the **Automated Financial Analysis System**. This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough for setting up, configuring, and running the application on an Ubuntu 24.04.1 host using Docker and Docker Compose.

This guide is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who wish to deploy the application in a stable, reproducible, and isolated environment. Beyond simple commands, this document delves into the rationale behind our architectural choices, offering a deep understanding of how each component works.

### 1.2. About the Deployment Strategy

The chosen deployment strategy prioritizes **robustness, portability, and scalability**. By containerizing the application with Docker, we eliminate the "it works on my machine" problem. The entire application, along with its specific Python version and all dependencies, is packaged into a single, portable unit called a Docker image.

We use Docker Compose to define and manage our multi-service application, which includes the main Python analyzer and a Redis database for caching. This approach simplifies the entire deployment process into a few declarative commands, making it incredibly efficient and reliable.

### 1.3. What is Docker and Docker Compose?

*   **Docker** is a platform that enables you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. It isolates the application from the host system, ensuring consistency across different environments.

*   **Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a single YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`), you configure all of your application’s services (e.g., your Python app, a database, a caching server). Then, with a single command, you can create and start all the services from your configuration. It's the standard way to manage the lifecycle of containerized applications during development and in many production scenarios.

---

## Part 1: Prerequisites & Host Setup

### 2.1. System Requirements

*   **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble Numbat). While the Dockerized application can run on any OS that supports Docker, these setup instructions are specific to this version of Ubuntu.
*   **Architecture:** `x86_64` / `amd64`.
*   **RAM:** 4GB or more is recommended for smooth operation.
*   **Disk Space:** At least 10GB of free disk space for Docker images, containers, and generated reports.
*   **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading Docker, base images, and financial data from the SEC.

### 2.2. Installing Docker Engine on Ubuntu 24.04

We will install Docker Engine from Docker's official `apt` repository, which is the recommended approach for ensuring we have the latest and most stable version.

**Step 1: Set up Docker's `apt` repository.**
First, update your package index and install the packages required to use an HTTPS repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
```

**Step 2: Add Docker’s official GPG key.**
This key verifies the integrity of the packages you are about to download.

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

**Step 3: Add the repository to your `apt` sources.**
This command tells your system where to find the Docker packages.

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

**Step 4: Install Docker Engine.**
Finally, update your package index again with the new repository and install Docker Engine, the command-line interface (CLI), and containerd.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin
```

### 2.3. Installing Docker Compose

The `docker-compose-plugin` allows you to use `docker compose` as a direct subcommand of `docker`. This is the modern, integrated way to use Compose.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose-plugin
```

### 2.4. Post-Installation Steps for Docker

By default, the `docker` command requires `sudo`. To run Docker commands without `sudo`, you need to add your user to the `docker` group.

**Step 1: Create the `docker` group (it likely already exists).**

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

**Step 2: Add your user to the `docker` group.**
Replace `${USER}` with your actual username.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

**Step 3: Apply the new group membership.**
You must **log out and log back in** for this change to take effect. Alternatively, you can run the following command to activate the changes for your current terminal session:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

### 2.5. Verifying the Installation

After logging back in, verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed correctly and can be run without `sudo`.

```bash
docker --version
# Expected output: Docker version 26.x.x, build ...

docker compose version
# Expected output: Docker Compose version v2.x.x
```

You can also run the "hello-world" image to confirm that Docker is fully operational.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you see a message starting with "Hello from Docker!", your installation is successful.

---

## Part 2: Project Configuration

### 3.1. Cloning the Repository

Before you can run the application, you need its source code. Clone the project repository from your version control system (e.g., GitHub).

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd automated-financial-analysis
```

### 3.2. Understanding the Project Structure

The project has a specific structure that our Docker setup relies on.

```
/
├── .env.example        # Example environment variables
├── docker-compose.yml  # Defines the multi-service Docker environment
├── Dockerfile          # Instructions to build the application image
├── main.py             # The main CLI entry point
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── reports/            # Output directory for generated reports (mounted as a volume)
├── logs/               # Output directory for log files (mounted as a volume)
└── src/                # The main application source code package
    └── financial_analysis/
```

### 3.3. Environment Variable Configuration (`.env` file)

Sensitive or environment-specific configuration should not be hardcoded in the application or checked into version control. We manage this using a `.env` file.

**Action:** Copy the example file to create your own local configuration file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, **open the `.env` file** with a text editor and modify the variables.

**`SEC_USER_AGENT`**

This is the most important variable you must change. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires a descriptive `User-Agent` string for all automated traffic to their EDGAR API. This helps them track API usage and contact you if your script is causing issues.

**Change this:**

```
SEC_USER_AGENT="Automated Financial Analysis Project contact@mydomain.com"
```

**To your own information:**

```
SEC_USER_AGENT="Jane Doe Research jane.doe@university.edu"
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to automatically read this `.env` file and pass these variables into the `financial-analyzer` container's environment at runtime.

---

## Part 3: The Dockerfile - A Deep Dive

### 4.1. The Anatomy of Our `Dockerfile`

The `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a Docker image. It's like a recipe for creating our application's environment. Let's break down our `Dockerfile` to understand each step.

### 4.2. Base Image and Metadata

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm
LABEL maintainer="CodeNavigator AI"
```

*   `FROM`: This is the first instruction in any `Dockerfile`. It specifies the **base image** to build upon. We use `python:3.11-slim-bookworm`, which is an official Python image.
    *   `3.11`: This guarantees the exact version of Python our application was developed and tested with.
    *   `slim`: This variant is smaller than the full image, resulting in a faster download and a smaller final image size.
    *   `bookworm`: This specifies the underlying Debian OS version, ensuring stability and reproducibility.
*   `LABEL`: This instruction adds metadata to the image. It's useful for organization and identifying the image's purpose or creator.

### 4.3. System and Python Dependencies

```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/src
WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

*   `ENV`: Sets permanent environment variables within the image. `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` ensures that our `print` statements and logs are sent directly to the terminal without being buffered, which is essential for real-time log monitoring. `PYTHONPATH` tells Python where to find our source code modules, enabling clean imports like `from financial_analysis.core.models`.
*   `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory for all subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions.
*   `RUN apt-get ...`: This command executes shell commands inside the image. We use it to install system-level libraries that some of our Python packages might need to compile their C extensions.
*   `COPY requirements.txt .`: This copies *only* the `requirements.txt` file into the image.
*   `RUN pip install ...`: This installs all of our Python dependencies.

### 4.4. The Power of Layer Caching

Notice the order: we copy `requirements.txt` and install dependencies *before* we copy the rest of our application code. This is a critical Docker optimization technique.

Docker builds images in **layers**. Each instruction in the `Dockerfile` creates a new layer. When you rebuild an image, Docker checks if the source for a layer has changed. If not, it uses a cached version of that layer instead of re-running the command.

Since our Python dependencies (in `requirements.txt`) change far less frequently than our source code (`.py` files), this structure ensures that the time-consuming `pip install` step is only re-run when we explicitly change a dependency. This makes our development builds significantly faster.

### 4.5. Application Code and Final Configuration

```dockerfile
COPY ./src /app/src
COPY main.py .

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["python3", "main.py", "--ticker", "AAPL"]
```

*   `COPY . .`: This copies our application source code into the `WORKDIR` of the image.
*   `EXPOSE`: This instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. It doesn't actually publish the port; it functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs it. Our application doesn't have a web server yet, but this prepares it for future enhancements.
*   `CMD`: This provides the **default command** to execute when a container is started from this image. Our default command runs an analysis for the ticker `AAPL`. This command is easily overridden, as we'll see in Part 5.

---

## Part 4: The Docker Compose File - A Deep Dive

### 5.1. The Role of `docker-compose.yml`

If the `Dockerfile` is the recipe for a single dish (our application image), the `docker-compose.yml` file is the recipe for an entire multi-course meal. It describes how multiple services (our Python app, a Redis cache) fit together to form a complete application, defining their runtime configuration, networking, and storage.

### 5.2. Service Breakdown: `financial-analyzer`

This is the main service that runs our Python code.

```yaml
services:
  financial-analyzer:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    depends_on:
      - redis
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
      # ... other volumes
    networks:
      - financial-network
    command: >
      python3 main.py --ticker MSFT
    restart: unless-stopped
```

*   `build`: Tells Compose to build the image from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory (`.`).
*   `depends_on`: This is a crucial directive. It tells Compose that the `financial-analyzer` service depends on the `redis` service. Compose will ensure that the `redis` container is started *before* the `financial-analyzer` container is started.
*   `env_file`: Loads environment variables from the `.env` file we configured earlier.
*   `volumes`: This is one of the most powerful features. It creates a link between a directory on the host machine and a directory inside the container.
    *   `./src:/app/src`: This maps our local `src` directory to the `/app/src` directory in the container. **This means any changes you make to the Python code on your host machine are instantly reflected inside the container, without needing to rebuild the image.** This is fantastic for development.
    *   `./reports:/app/reports`: Any report file generated by the application inside `/app/reports` will be saved directly to the `reports/` directory on your host machine.
    *   `./logs:/app/logs`: Similarly, log files are persisted on the host.
*   `networks`: Attaches this service to our custom `financial-network`.
*   `command`: Overrides the default `CMD` from the `Dockerfile`. In our compose file, the default run is for `MSFT`.
*   `restart: unless-stopped`: A policy that tells Docker to automatically restart this container if it ever crashes, unless it was deliberately stopped.

### 5.3. Service Breakdown: `redis` (Our Caching Engine)

This service provides a high-performance in-memory cache for our application.

```yaml
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

*   `image: redis:7-alpine`: Instead of building from a `Dockerfile`, we are pulling a pre-built, official image directly from Docker Hub. The `alpine` tag indicates it's built on the minimal Alpine Linux distribution, making it very small.
*   `volumes: - redis-data:/data`: This maps a **named volume** called `redis-data` to the `/data` directory inside the Redis container, which is where Redis stores its data. This ensures that our cache is persisted even if we stop and remove the containers.

### 5.4. Understanding Volumes and Networks

*   **Named Volumes (`redis-data`):** These are managed by Docker itself and are the preferred way to persist data generated by containers. They are stored in a dedicated area on the host filesystem managed by Docker.
*   **Bind Mounts (`./src:/app/src`):** These map a specific directory from the host machine into the container. They are ideal for source code and persisting user-facing output like reports.
*   **Custom Networks (`financial-network`):** Creating a custom network allows our containers to communicate with each other using their service names. For example, our Python application can connect to Redis using the hostname `redis`, because they are on the same network. This is more secure and flexible than using legacy links or relying on the default bridge network.

---

## Part 5: Running the Analysis Workflow

### 6.1. Building and Running for the First Time

This command builds the `financial-analyzer` image (if it doesn't exist or if the `Dockerfile` has changed) and starts both the `financial-analyzer` and `redis` services.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

*   `up`: Brings services up (creates and starts them).
*   `--build`: Forces Docker to build the image before starting the container. You should use this the first time you run, or anytime you change the `Dockerfile` or `requirements.txt`.

You will see the logs from both services stream to your terminal. The application will run the default command from the `docker-compose.yml` file (analyzing `MSFT`).

### 6.2. Performing One-Off Analysis Runs

The most common use case will be to run the analysis for a specific ticker with specific options. We do this by overriding the default command using `docker compose run`.

```bash
docker compose run --rm financial-analyzer python3 main.py <TICKER> [OPTIONS]
```

*   `run`: Executes a one-off command in a new container for a service.
*   `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after the command exits. This is excellent for keeping your system clean from dozens of stopped containers after many runs.
*   `financial-analyzer`: The name of the service we want to run the command in.
*   `python3 main.py ...`: The new command that will be executed inside the container, overriding the default.

**Practical Examples:**

*   **Analyze Apple Inc. and generate both report types:**
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm financial-analyzer python3 main.py AAPL
    ```

*   **Analyze NVIDIA for the last 3 years and generate only the Excel report:**
    ```bash
    # Note: Our main.py does not yet have a --format option.
    # This example assumes future enhancement. For now, it will always generate both.
    docker compose run --rm financial-analyzer python3 main.py NVDA --years 3
    ```

*   **Analyze Google:**
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm financial-analyzer python3 main.py GOOGL
    ```

After each command finishes, check your `reports/` directory on your host machine to find the generated `.txt` and `.xlsx` files.

### 6.3. Running in the Background (Detached Mode)

If you wanted to run a service and leave it running in the background (more relevant for a future web API), you would use the `-d` (detach) flag.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts the services and returns you to the command prompt.

### 6.4. Interacting with a Running Container

If your services are running in the background, you can still execute commands inside them or get a shell.

*   **Execute a new analysis in a running container:**
    ```bash
    # Get the container ID or name first
    docker ps
    
    # Execute the command
    docker exec -it financial-analyzer python3 main.py TSLA
    ```
*   **Open an interactive bash shell for debugging:**
    ```bash
    docker exec -it financial-analyzer /bin/bash
    ```
    You will now be inside the container's shell, at the `/app` directory. You can run `ls`, `cat`, or execute Python scripts manually. Type `exit` to leave.

### 6.5. Stopping the Application

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes defined in your `docker-compose.yml`, use the `down` command.

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you want to stop the services without removing them, use `docker compose stop`.

## Part 6: Caching with Redis - How It Works

### 7.1. Why We Added a Cache

Financial data from sources like the SEC doesn't change every second. The facts for a company's 2023 10-K filing will be the same today, tomorrow, and next week. Making a network request to the SEC's API every single time we analyze the same company is inefficient and puts unnecessary load on their servers.

To solve this, we've integrated a **Redis caching layer**. Redis is an extremely fast in-memory key-value store, perfect for this task.

### 7.2. The Caching Logic in Action

Our `SecEdgarProvider` has been upgraded with caching logic. The workflow is now:

1.  When a request for a company's data (e.g., facts for CIK `0000320193`) is made, the provider first generates a unique cache key (e.g., `sec:facts:0000320193`).
2.  It asks the **Redis service** if data exists for this key.
3.  **Cache Hit:** If Redis has the data, it's returned instantly without any network call to the SEC. You will see a `Cache HIT` message in the logs.
4.  **Cache Miss:** If Redis does not have the data, the provider makes the normal network request to the SEC API.
5.  Once the data is successfully fetched from the SEC, it is stored in Redis with the cache key and a 24-hour expiration time. The data is then returned to the application.
6.  The next time the same ticker is analyzed within 24 hours, it will result in a cache hit.

### 7.3. Benefits of the Caching Layer

*   **Performance:** Subsequent analyses of the same company are dramatically faster.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of API calls to external services, making us a more responsible API consumer.
*   **Resilience:** If the SEC API is temporarily down, we might still be able to run an analysis if the data is in our cache.

---

## Part 7: Maintenance and Troubleshooting

### 8.1. Viewing Application Logs

You can view the real-time logs of all services or a specific service.

*   **Follow logs for all services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```
*   **Follow logs for only the Python application:**
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f financial-analyzer
    ```
    Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following.

### 8.2. Rebuilding the Image After Code Changes

*   If you only change Python code in the `src` directory, you do **not** need to rebuild the image due to our volume mount. Simply re-run the `docker compose run` command.
*   You **must** rebuild the image if you change:
    *   `Dockerfile`
    *   `requirements.txt`
    *   Any file that is `COPY`ed into the image but not mounted as a volume.

    To rebuild, use the `--build` flag:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    # or for a one-off run
    docker compose run --build --rm financial-analyzer python3 main.py <TICKER>
    ```

### 8.3. Managing Docker Resources

*   **List running containers:** `docker ps`
*   **List all containers (including stopped):** `docker ps -a`
*   **List images:** `docker images`
*   **Prune unused resources:** To clean up unused containers, networks, and dangling images, you can run:
    ```bash
    docker system prune -a
    ```
    Use with caution, as this will remove all stopped containers and unused data.
