The user has approved Phase 3 and wants me to proceed with Phase 4.

**Phase 4: Professional Report Generation**

This phase is about presentation. I have all the data and analysis in my `CompanyAnalysis` data model. Now I need to output it in clean, professional, and human-readable formats.

**Phase 4 Breakdown:**
1.  **Step 4.1: Define the Reporter Interface**
    *   File: `src/financial_analysis/reporting/base_reporter.py`
    *   Goal: Create an Abstract Base Class (ABC) to define a common `generate_report` method for all reporter types.
2.  **Step 4.2: Implement the Text Reporter**
    *   File: `src/financial_analysis/reporting/text_reporter.py`
    *   Goal: Create a simple, clean, and well-formatted `.txt` report.
3.  **Step 4.3: Implement the Excel Reporter**
    *   File: `src/financial_analysis/reporting/excel_reporter.py`
    *   Goal: Create a more sophisticated `.xlsx` report with multiple, well-formatted sheets for different data types (raw data, ratios, analysis).

I will now proceed with my deep-thinking and option exploration process for this phase.

### **Deep-Thinking & Option Exploration for Phase 4**

**1. Reporter Interface (`base_reporter.py`)**

*   **Design:** An `ABC` is the correct approach, just like with the data providers. This ensures any new reporter (e.g., a future `HtmlReporter` or `PdfReporter`) will plug into the system seamlessly.
*   **Method Signature:** The planned method `generate_report(self, analysis: CompanyAnalysis, output_path: str) -> None:` is perfect. It takes the complete analysis object and the desired output file path. It doesn't need to return anything as its side effect is creating a file.

**2. Text Reporter (`text_reporter.py`)**

*   **Formatting Options:**
    *   **Option A: Simple f-strings.** Use basic f-strings with `\n` for newlines. This is easy but can be messy for complex layouts and hard to maintain.
    *   **Option B: `textwrap` module.** Use Python's built-in `textwrap` module to handle line wrapping for long paragraphs of analysis, ensuring the output is nicely formatted within a certain line width.
    *   **Option C: Template strings.** Use `string.Template` for a slightly more structured approach.
    *   **Option D: A full templating engine.** Use a lightweight templating engine like Jinja2, even for text output. This is very powerful but adds a dependency and might be overkill for a simple text file.
    *   **Decision:** Option B combined with f-strings is the most elegant and practical solution. It gives me the power of f-strings for data injection and the formatting control of `textwrap` for readability, without adding external dependencies. I will structure the report with clear headers (e.g., `='=' * 20`) to delineate sections.

*   **Data Presentation:** I will present the data in a clear, hierarchical manner.
    *   Executive Summary first.
    *   Then, a summary of key ratios.
    *   Followed by detailed textual analysis for each section.
    *   Finally, the raw data tables (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) for one or two recent years for reference. I will format these tables using string padding to align columns.

**3. Excel Reporter (`excel_reporter.py`)**

*   **Library Choice:**
    *   The `pandas` library, in conjunction with an engine like `openpyxl` (which is already in our `requirements.txt`), is the standard and most powerful way to create Excel files in Python. It handles data conversion to DataFrames and writing to multiple sheets seamlessly.
    *   **Decision:** I will use `pandas` and `openpyxl`.

*   **Sheet Structure:** My plan called for separate sheets for 'Financial Data', 'Financial Ratios', and 'Analysis Summary'. This is a good, clean structure.
    *   **Financial Data Sheet:** This sheet will contain the raw numbers from the `FinancialStatement` objects. Each row will represent a year, and each column a financial metric (e.g., Revenue, Total Assets).
    *   **Financial Ratios Sheet:** Similar to the data sheet, but for the calculated ratios from the `FinancialRatios` objects.
    *   **Analysis Summary Sheet:** This will contain the qualitative analysis. Instead of one long text block, I'll structure it as a key-value table: one column for the analysis area (e.g., "Overall Summary", "Liquidity Analysis", "Key Strengths") and another for the corresponding text. This is much cleaner than a single cell with a giant text blob.
    *   **Company Info Sheet:** It would be good practice to add a dedicated 'Cover Sheet' or 'Summary' sheet that contains the `CompanyInfo` data (Name, Ticker, Sector, etc.) and the high-level assessment.

*   **Formatting and Styling:**
    *   **Option A: No styling.** Just dump the data. Functional, but not "professional."
    *   **Option B: Basic styling with `openpyxl` or `xlsxwriter`.** After writing the data with pandas, I can re-open the workbook with a styling library to adjust column widths, apply number formatting (e.g., currency, percentages), and make headers bold. `openpyxl` can do this.
    *   **Decision:** Option B is essential to meet the "professional investment-grade" aspiration. I will use `pandas` to write the data and then `openpyxl` (which pandas uses as its engine) to apply formatting. This includes:
        *   Auto-fitting column widths.
        *   Applying number formats (e.g., `$#,##0` for currency, `0.00%` for percentages).
        *   Making header rows bold.
        *   Freezing the top row for scrollable tables.

### **Execution Plan for Phase 4**

I will now execute the plan for Phase 4, taking a step-by-step approach to build the reporting components.

**Step 4.1: Define the Reporter Interface**
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Create the file `src/financial_analysis/reporting/base_reporter.py`.
    2.  Import `ABC`, `abstractmethod`, and the `CompanyAnalysis` model.
    3.  Define the `BaseReporter` abstract class.
    4.  Define the single abstract method `generate_report(self, analysis: CompanyAnalysis, output_path: str) -> None`.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] `base_reporter.py` file is created.
    *   [ ] `BaseReporter` class inherits from `ABC`.
    *   [ ] The abstract method `generate_report` is correctly defined with the specified signature and type hints.

**Step 4.2: Implement the Text Reporter**
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Create the file `src/financial_analysis/reporting/text_reporter.py`.
    2.  Implement the `TextReporter` class, inheriting from `BaseReporter`.
    3.  Implement the `generate_report` method.
    4.  Inside the method, build the report string section by section: Executive Summary, Key Ratios, Detailed Analysis, etc.
    5.  Use helper methods to format different sections (e.g., `_format_summary`, `_format_ratios_table`).
    6.  Use f-strings for data injection and `textwrap` for formatting long paragraphs.
    7.  Include prominent disclaimers.
    8.  Write the final string to the specified `output_path`.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] `text_reporter.py` file is created.
    *   [ ] `TextReporter` correctly implements the `BaseReporter` interface.
    *   [ ] The report includes all required sections in a logical order.
    *   [ ] The output is well-formatted and readable.
    *   [ ] Disclaimers and data source information are included.
    *   [ ] The file is correctly written to the specified path.

**Step 4.3: Implement the Excel Reporter**
*   **Plan:**
    1.  Create the file `src/financial_analysis/reporting/excel_reporter.py`.
    2.  Implement the `ExcelReporter` class, inheriting from `BaseReporter`.
    3.  Implement the `generate_report` method.
    4.  Inside the method, use `pandas.ExcelWriter` to create a workbook.
    5.  Create `pandas.DataFrame` objects from the `CompanyAnalysis` data (one for statements, one for ratios).
    6.  Write each DataFrame to a separate sheet in the workbook.
    7.  Create a DataFrame for the qualitative analysis and write it to an "Analysis" sheet.
    8.  After writing the data, use the `writer.book` (`openpyxl` workbook object) and `writer.sheets` to apply formatting: set column widths, apply number formats, bold headers, and freeze panes.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   [ ] `excel_reporter.py` file is created.
    *   [ ] `ExcelReporter` correctly implements the `BaseReporter` interface.
    *   [ ] `pandas` is used to create and write data to multiple sheets.
    *   [ ] The sheet structure is logical (e.g., Summary, Statements, Ratios, Analysis).
    *   [ ] Post-write formatting (column widths, number formats, styles) is applied using `openpyxl`.
    *   [ ] The final `.xlsx` file is saved correctly.

I am now fully prepared to begin the implementation of Phase 4.
