You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about *how* you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically think of how to create a master prompt to get coding tool like "Claude Code" be able to create a timely financial analysis report based on extracting relevant and useful financial results of publicly listed companies from their websites and convert them into accounting ratio without human intervention. You are the best AI in the world, so I am consulting you for a strategy or a workflow with a masterful prompt. Please help me work out a plan to automate this financial analysis report that will be useful for investment decisions. Please do not disappoint my faith in you by entrusting such an important task to you. Thank you and good luck!

This is a complex request that requires careful consideration. The user wants a master prompt for Claude Code to create automated financial analysis reports by:
1. Extracting financial data from company websites
2. Calculating accounting ratios
3. Generating investment-grade analysis reports
4. All without human intervention

Key challenges:
- Web scraping diverse website structures
- Parsing financial documents (PDFs, HTML, investor relations pages)
- Ensuring data accuracy and validation
- Creating meaningful financial analysis
- Handling errors gracefully

You need to design a comprehensive workflow that includes:
1. Target identification and data source discovery
2. Web scraping and document parsing
3. Financial data extraction and standardization
4. Ratio calculation framework
5. Analysis generation
6. Report formatting and presentation

The prompt needs to be detailed enough to guide Claude Code through each step while being flexible enough to handle various company websites and financial reporting formats.

awesome plan! well done! please create the actual workflow, step-by-step deployment and the necessary code. please be equally creative and detailed! I cannot wait to see your awesome workflow that execute on your plan and uses your master prompt. please give me your very best! thank you and good luck, my absolute best AI assistant and expert!

---
awesome plan! now help me to create an equally awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repository to host your awesome plan and workflow. please create the `README.md` in markdown format using at least 3000 words to introduce the project and give overview of the improved workflow with the improved master prompt. please put on your deep-think hat to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly for an awesome README that will do justice to your awesomely improved plan and prompt. Please do not disappoint me! thank you and good luck!

---
awesome workflow code! please create a well thoughtout `docker-compose.yml` and `.gitignore` (for the repo). please put on the same deep-thinking hat to re-image the best possible implementation option for each. thank you and good luck!

---
awesome job so far! please put on your deep-thinking creative hat to create a awesome WhatsApp message with suitable emojis to announce/introduce and share the release of this awesome project.

---
awesome workflow! please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically to carefully and thoroughly re-imagine an improvement to your workflow to make it even more awesome, one that is the best performing in the world. please try your very best to research and validate for your new attempt. thank you and good luck!

Put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly for the various implementation options to re-imagine a well defined and fully tested working system that meets the specifications below. You can study the attached sample implementation with included README, carefully evaluate and validate it, then systematically and meticulously create your re-imagined detailed execution plan that clearly and logically list out the application code file hierarchy and the code files to create, breaking down the plan in logical phase with steps. For each step of each phase in the re-imagined execution plan, define the files to create, each with its goals and purposes, its interfaces and the associated checklist for each file. Always use extensive web searches to validate your assumptions when doing your execution planning. Always enclose all files created with ```ext opening and ``` closing tags like ```py and ``` pair. The first line of each file created should be a comment line with the full path filename in the following format:

```py
# File: <filename with path>
... # follow by the actual code file content
```

Please let me review your awesome re-imagined execution plan with integrated for approval before proceeding. Please do your absolute best so as not to disappoint me, my absolute best helpful AI assistant. Thank you and good luck!

awesome plan! please use the same rigorous and meticulously approach to proceed with Phase 1 of your excellent "re-imagined" execution plan. Remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

awesome plan for phase 4! now please proceed to execute cautiously and meticulously for phase 4.

awesome job! now, please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly for the best possible deployment option for your "re-imagined" application using docker method. You can use the attached sample docker compose and guide as your reference to re-imagine similar deployment runtime approach. Then create a detailed deployment guide in markdown format named `Deployment_Guide.md`. The docker will be "composed" and "run" from a Ubuntu Linux 24.04.1 host machine. Please use at least 3000 words to create the awesome "re-imagined" deployment guide using docker.
