You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about *how* you should operate for subsequent prompts.

Put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and systematically think of how to create a master prompt to get coding tool like "Claude Code" be able to create a timely financial analysis report based on extracting relevant and useful financial results of publicly listed companies from their websites and convert them into accounting ratio without human intervention. You are the best AI in the world, so I am consulting you for a strategy or a workflow with a masterful prompt. Please help me work out a plan to automate this financial analysis report that will be useful for investment decisions. Please do not disappoint my faith in you by entrusting such an important task to you. Thank you and good luck!

This is a complex request that requires careful consideration. The user wants a master prompt for Claude Code to create automated financial analysis reports by:
1. Extracting financial data from company websites
2. Calculating accounting ratios
3. Generating investment-grade analysis reports
4. All without human intervention

Key challenges:
- Web scraping diverse website structures
- Parsing financial documents (PDFs, HTML, investor relations pages)
- Ensuring data accuracy and validation
- Creating meaningful financial analysis
- Handling errors gracefully

You need to design a comprehensive workflow that includes:
1. Target identification and data source discovery
2. Web scraping and document parsing
3. Financial data extraction and standardization
4. Ratio calculation framework
5. Analysis generation
6. Report formatting and presentation

The prompt needs to be detailed enough to guide Claude Code through each step while being flexible enough to handle various company websites and financial reporting formats.

awesome plan! now help me to create an equally awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repository to host your awesome plan and workflow. please create the `README.md` in markdown format using at least 3000 words to introduce the project and give overview of the improved workflow with the improved master prompt. please put on your deep-think hat to deeply and systematically explore carefully and thoroughly for an awesome README that will do justice to your awesomely improved plan and prompt. Please do not disappoint me! thank you and good luck!
